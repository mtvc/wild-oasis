# React + Vite

Booking system for any hotel, hostel or similar acomodation. Provides tracking of check ins and checkouts, accommodation occupancy and other statistics.

This is the project done in Jonas Schmedtmann's React Course and is for demonstrating some fundamental React principles.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
